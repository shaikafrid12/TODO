# Deployment Fix Plan

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Add path import to backend/server.js
- [x] Verify environment variables for mongodb and PORT are set
- [x] Test the deployment by running the server

## Information Gathered
- backend/server.js uses path module but does not import it, causing potential errors in serving frontend.
- Environment variables for mongodb and PORT are assumed to be set as per user confirmation.

## Dependent Files
- backend/server.js

## Followup Steps
- After editing, run the server to ensure frontend is served correctly from frontend/dist.
